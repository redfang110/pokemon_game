Assignment 1.01
09/05/2022: 
Stated map generation project. 
Created functions-
    	int main(int argc, char *argv[]): IN PROGRESS - -should call all necessary functions to randomly generate and print a map
        	initializes 2d map array full of '-' passes array to generate()
    	void generate(char map[80][21]): IN PROGRESS -  -should fill passed 2d array with a randomly generated map
        	has seed arrays for tall grass, short grass, forest, and mountains (organized {x1, y1, x2, y2, ...}).
        	initializes each array by calling getSeed()
    	int * getSeed(int size): FINISHED -             -should return an array of random seeds 
        	takes desired size of array and returns a random seed location (does not generate seeds on the map border).
    	void civalize(int map[80][21]): IN PROGRESS -   -finishing touches. 
				Should put paths, pokemart, pokecenter, and maybe random rocks and trees on the map.
        	asigns random x coordinate to pokemart and random y coordinate to pokecenter. 
        	Initializes an array of 4 points where the roads leave the map.

09/06/2022: 
Added albelian sandpile implementation for region seed growth.
Got stuck on sandpile implementation (lots of bugs and crashing); restarted with rectangle implementation instead
Functions
	int main(): FINISHED -		-initializes map 2d array and calls generate
	void generate(): FINISHED -	-calls get_grid() several times using for loop, then calls fill(), civilize(), and print_table()
	void get_grid(): FINISHED-	-takes an array of 4 ints (x1, y1, x2, y2) and fills the rectangle between those points
	void fill(): FINISHED-		-nested for loop checks for uninitialized variables and sets them to 4 (%) (this is where border is initialized)
	void civilize(): FINISHED-	-generates randomized straight roads (N-S and E-W) and 4x4 poke mart and pokecenter 
	void print_table(): FINISHED-	-prints the map out with a space separating each character

Assignment 1.02
09/13/2022
Created 
	map struct containing an int terrain[21][80] and 4 ints (1 for each direction of road) 
	world struct containing a map *maps[401][401], ints for current position, and an int for quit
	updated all old functions for new implementation

09/14/2022
Created
	void menu(): FINISHED -				-takes char input from user (passed from main) and excecutes relevant command
	void check_direction(): FINISHED -	-takes an array of length 4 and a pointer to the world. It fills the array with location of adjacent exits (in the order n, e, s, w)
Made lots of implementation changes to void civilize(): to make roads meet in the middle if opposite exit is not the same value, account for the edge of the world, etc.
Made lots of changes to main.
Updated map struct to contain and int x, y for where it exists in the world and int d for the probability that buildings spawn within the map.

Assignment 1.03
09/19/2022
Downloadeded Prof 1.02 solution and spent the day trying to understand what was going on
Problems
	Not sure what to change about dijstra_map
Created
	void dijkstra_map(): IN PROGRESS-	-copy of dijkstra_path changing path to map: this function will fill passed 2d arrays with movement values

09/20/2022-09/24/2022
Made minimal changes and tried to digest proffesors code
Problems
	Failed to digest much

09/25/2022
Added 4 if statements for kitty corner cases for dijkstras map
Tried to digest professors code 
Problems
	Got lost on what to else change

09/26/2022
Added && !edge_penalty(p->pos[dim_x], p->pos[dim_y]) to ifirst if in while ((p = heap_remove_min(&h))) && commented out return
Problems
	Cannot figure out how to save number map
	Need to update makefile, professors is very confusing
Created
	int game_loop(): IN PROGRESS-		-moved most of main to this to make main cleaner and comment it out easily

09/27/2022
Created
	int terrain_cost(): FINISHED-		-takes enum of character and terrain type, does nested switch to return movement value of that caracter type for that terrain type

09/28/2022
Created
	void print_dist_map(): FINSIHED-	-takes a character enum and prints the associated movement map
	void place_player(): FINISHED-		-randomly places PC somewhere on a road
Removed
	&& !edge_penalty(p->pos[dim_x], p->pos[dim_y]) to ifirst if in while ((p = heap_remove_min(&h))) && commented out return
Updated
	void print_map(): UPDATE-			-	ADDED an if to print PC (else switch)
	struct world{}: UPDATE-				-	ADDED PC pair_t, 2d int array for hiker and rival maps
	int main(): UPDATE-					-	UPDATED to call dijkstra_map() and 
												send user into game_loop() after printing distance maps
	void dijkstra_map(): FINISHED-		-	ADDED if else to set INT_MAX nodes to NULL
											ADDED switch (character enum) to put map in proper character map
												(uses nested for loops to copy path into correct 
												character distance map within world)
												(if edge case sets value to INT_MAX if it is an edge)
											REMOVED all calls to edge_penalty()
											REMOVED "from" from function 
											REMOVED killswitch if within while (the one with the return)
											UPDATED changed directional if conditions
												(changed to ... && cost > cost + terrain_cost() of current position)
											UPDATED changed what I set the cost to
												(cost = cost + terrain_cost() of current position)
											UPDATED changed 0 initialization from "from" to "to"
												(this means we are calculating distance from PC 
												instead of from where the path started)
											UPDATED nested for loop to go from 0-MAP
