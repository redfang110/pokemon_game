Assignment 1.01

Stated map generation project. 
Created functions-
    	int main(int argc, char *argv[]): IN PROGRESS - -should call all necessary functions to randomly generate and print a map
        	initializes 2d map array full of '-' passes array to generate()
    	void generate(char map[80][21]): IN PROGRESS -  -should fill passed 2d array with a randomly generated map
        	has seed arrays for tall grass, short grass, forest, and mountains (organized {x1, y1, x2, y2, ...}).
        	initializes each array by calling getSeed()
    	int * getSeed(int size): FINISHED -             -should return an array of random seeds 
        	takes desired size of array and returns a random seed location (does not generate seeds on the map border).
    	void civalize(int map[80][21]): IN PROGRESS -   -finishing touches. 
				Should put paths, pokemart, pokecenter, and maybe random rocks and trees on the map.
        	asigns random x coordinate to pokemart and random y coordinate to pokecenter. 
        	Initializes an array of 4 points where the roads leave the map.
09/06/2022: 
Added albelian sandpile implementation for region seed growth.
Got stuck on sandpile implementation (lots of bugs and crashing); restarted with rectangle implementation instead
Functions
	int main(): FINISHED -		-initializes map 2d array and calls generate
	void generate(): FINISHED -	-calls get_grid() several times using for loop, then calls fill(), civilize(), and print_table()
	void get_grid(): FINISHED-	-takes an array of 4 ints (x1, y1, x2, y2) and fills the rectangle between those points
	void fill(): FINISHED-		-nested for loop checks for uninitialized variables and sets them to 4 (%) (this is where border is initialized)
	void civilize(): FINISHED-	-generates randomized straight roads (N-S and E-W) and 4x4 poke mart and pokecenter 
	void print_table(): FINISHED-	-prints the map out with a space separating each character

Assignment 1.02
09/13/2022
Created 
	map struct containing an int terrain[21][80] and 4 ints (1 for each direction of road) 
	world struct containing a map *maps[401][401], ints for current position, and an int for quit
	updated all old functions for new implementation
09/14/2022
Created
	void menu(): FINISHED -				-takes char input from user (passed from main) and excecutes relevant command
	void check_direction(): FINISHED -	-takes an array of length 4 and a pointer to the world. It fills the array with location of adjacent exits (/*in the order n, e, s, w*/)
Made lots of implementation changes to void civilize(): to make roads meet in the middle if opposite exit is not the same value, account for the edge of the world, etc.
Made lots of changes to main.
Updated map struct to contain and int x, y for where it exists in the world and int d for the probability that buildings spawn within the map.
