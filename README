This program generates a map (described below), 
    randomly places a player character on a road and npc throughout the map,
    and then generates a movement map for a hiker character and rival character

The program allows you to make various moves, encounter npcs in battle, display a list of npcs, and enter poker marts and poke centers.

This is a program that generates a 401x401 world.
Each unit of the world is made of 80x21 maps.
Each map is made up of 
    (at least 2 regions) small grass (.), 
    (at least 2 regions) tall grass (:), 
    forests (or trees) (^), 
    and mountains (or boulders) (%) with 2 roads going N-S and E-W, 
    a pokemart, 
    and a pokecenter. 
The player can navigate manually by inputting hjklyubn, open npc list with t (close with esc)(Poke-battles are closed with esc), or enter a poke mart/center with < (close with >), or quit by inputting q
